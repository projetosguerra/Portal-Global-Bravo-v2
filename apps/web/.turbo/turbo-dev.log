 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Users\pietr\pnpm-lock.yaml as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `outputFileTracingRoot` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats for more information.

 ✓ Starting...

   We detected TypeScript in your project and reconfigured your tsconfig.json file for you. Strict-mode is set to false by default.
   The following suggested values were added to your tsconfig.json. These values can be changed to fit your project's needs:

   	- incremental was set to true
   	- include was updated to add '.next/types/**/*.ts'
   	- plugins was updated to add { name: 'next' }
   	- exclude was set to ['node_modules']

   The following mandatory changes were made to your tsconfig.json:

   	- esModuleInterop was set to true (requirement for SWC / babel)
   	- isolatedModules was set to true (requirement for SWC / Babel)
   	- jsx was set to preserve (next.js implements its own optimized jsx transform)
